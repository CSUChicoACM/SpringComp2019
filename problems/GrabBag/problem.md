# Grab Bag

Joel and Amy are playing a game of chance. They start with a bag containing __*r*__ red marbles, and __*b*__ black marbles. Both take turns drawing a single marble from the bag and discarding it, beginning with Joel. If the player draws a red marble, they immediately lose the game and the other player is deemed the winner. If the player draws a black marble, the game continues with the other player's turn. The marbles are *not* returned to the bag after being drawn. Given the number of red and black marbles starting in the bag, what are the odds the Joel wins the game.

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers, __*r*__ and __*b*__, the number of red and black marbles respectively.

## Constraints

- 1 <= __*r*__ <= 100
- 1 <= __*b*__ <= 100

## Output Format

Print the percent chance that Joel wins the game, precise to 5 decimal places, followed by a newline.
